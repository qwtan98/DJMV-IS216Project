## Our Problem Statement

They are faced with the constant challenge to find an essential platform where they can convieniently grow their investment knowledge.

## About the Project
Mikro is a one-stop knowledge investment platform to increase financial inclusion and literacy among migrant workers in Singapore, that helps to kickstart and improve their knowledge on investing.
